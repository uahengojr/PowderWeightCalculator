# PowderWeightCalculator

 This repo implementing a back calcualtion using theoretical density, mole, and the number of atoms in a unit cell to compute the desired pellet/sample thicknes (height) produced via Curent Activated Pressure Assited Densification (CAPAD).
 
##How To Use
This program requires MatLab2016a install on your machine. Load the file into your workspace, and run the WieghtCalculator.fig. A GUI pops-up displaying input parameters:  
 
* _Thickness (cm)_ - desired sample thickness.  
* _Density (g/cm^3)_ - density of the nano-powder chemical compound.  
* _Diameter (cm)_ - graphite die diameter.  
* _Atom #_ - Number of atoms in unit cell.
