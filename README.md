# PowderWeightCalculator

 This repo contains MatLab code implementing theoretical density computaion based off a desired CAPAD produced pellet/sample thicknes (height). 
 
##How To Use
This program requires MatLAb2016a install on your machine. Load the file into your workspace, and run the WieghtCalculator.fig. A GUI pops-up displaying input parameters:  
 
 _Thickness (cm)_ - desired sample thickness.  
 _Density (g/cm^3)_ - density of the nano-powder chemical compound.  
 _Diameter (cm)_ - graphite die diameter.  
 _Atom #_ - Number of attoms in unit cell.
